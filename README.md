## things i want

### API related
- easy, clean access to all data, meaning:
  + full text search over all generated audio in history
  + for any given voice, getting settings, training samples, all generated text

### general audio related
- crop audios using text
  + get speech tagger, use timestamps to crop
    - OpenAI Whisper is strong, but requires GPU to run

### misc
- all this in a nice interface, probably with tkinter.
- not guaranteeing i will do this. this is just what i want.
